            <h3>The Lost Key</h3>
            <p><strong>Preview:</strong> In a forgotten village, Mia found a key glowing faintly in the dirt. She didn’t know it unlocked a door no one had seen in centuries...</p>
            <button onclick="toggleStory('story1')">Read Full Story</button>
            <div id="story1" class="full-story">
                <p>Mia brushed the soil off the key, its faint pulse warming her fingers. The village elders had spoken of a hidden vault, sealed since the Great Frost centuries ago. Curiosity gnawed at her, so she set out at dawn, the key clutched tight. She climbed the hill to the ancient oak, its gnarled roots sprawling like veins. Beneath its shadow, she spotted a rusted lock embedded in stone.</p>
                <p>With a trembling hand, she inserted the key. The ground shuddered, and a slab slid away, revealing spiral steps descending into darkness. Torch in hand, she ventured down. The air grew thick, humming with energy. At the bottom, she found a cavern lined with shelves—endless rows of books, their covers glowing faintly like the key. A voice, soft and ancient, echoed: “You’ve found the Library of Lost Dreams. You are its keeper now.”</p>
                <p>Mia’s heart raced. She opened a book, and visions of forgotten lives flooded her mind. She knew she’d never return to the village—not when she held the stories of the world below her feet.</p>

            <h3>Starbound Signal</h3>
            <p><strong>Preview:</strong> A radio crackled to life on Eli’s desk, broadcasting a voice from a starship lost decades ago...</p>
            <button onclick="toggleStory('story2')">Read Full Story</button>
            <div id="story2" class="full-story">
                <p>Eli was tinkering in his attic when the old radio sparked to life. Static cleared, and a voice emerged: “This is Starbound, Day 472. We’re lost beyond the nebula. Supplies low.” His stomach dropped—the voice was his own, though he’d never left Earth. He turned the dial, but the signal held, growing clearer each night.</p>
                <p>By Day 480, the logs mirrored his life: “Eli ate oatmeal today. He’s restless.” He hadn’t told a soul about the oatmeal. Panic set in. He dug through archives—Starbound vanished 30 years ago, crew presumed dead. Yet here it was, narrating his existence. On Day 499, the voice rasped, “Tomorrow, you’ll join us.”</p>
                <p>Eli smashed the radio, shards scattering across the floor. Silence fell—then a hum rose from the wreckage. His own voice whispered, “You can’t escape the signal.” The attic dimmed, stars blinked through the ceiling, and Eli felt weightless, pulled toward an unseen ship.</p>

            <h3>The Dust of Hope</h3>
            <p><strong>Preview:</strong> In 1932, Clara watched the dust storms swallow her family’s farm, wondering if hope could survive where crops couldn’t...</p>
            <button onclick="toggleStory('story3')">Read Full Story</button>
            <div id="story3" class="full-story">
                <p>Clara stood on the porch of the sagging Oklahoma farmhouse, her apron whipping in the dry wind. It was 1932, and the Great Depression had already taken her father’s pride, her brother’s dreams, and now the land itself. Dust storms rolled in like black tides, burying the wheat fields her family had tended for generations. The bank had come calling last month, papers in hand, but there was nothing left to repossess—just dirt and despair.</p>
                <p>She was sixteen, too young to carry the weight of it all, yet too stubborn to leave. Her mother coughed inside, lungs clogged from years of breathing the grit. “We’ll make it,” Clara whispered to herself, clutching a jar of pennies she’d hidden under the floorboards—twenty-three cents, her last stand against starvation. The radio crackled faintly, promising relief from Roosevelt’s voice, but the words felt as distant as rain.</p>
                <p>One morning, a stranger limped up the road, his suit tattered but his eyes sharp. “Got any work?” he asked. Clara shook her head, but offered him a sip of water from their dwindling well. He stayed anyway, teaching her to rig a windbreak from scrap wood and showing her how to trap rabbits in the barren fields. His name was Tom, a drifter from Kansas, and he spoke of a world beyond the dust—a place where rivers still ran and jobs might bloom again.</p>
                <p>Weeks passed, and Tom became a fixture, his quiet strength stitching their little family back together. The pennies bought seeds from a passing peddler, and with Tom’s help, Clara planted them behind the windbreak, praying for a miracle. The first green sprout broke through in spring, fragile but defiant. It wasn’t much—just a whisper of life—but to Clara, it was proof that hope could root even in the dust.</p>

            <h3>The Strength of the World</h3>
            <p><strong>Preview:</strong> In a crumbling city, Lena discovered that the world’s true strength wasn’t in its towers, but in the hands that rebuilt them...</p>
            <button onclick="toggleStory('story4')">Read Full Story</button>
            <div id="story4" class="full-story">
                <p>Lena walked through the skeletal remains of the city, its skyline jagged with broken steel and shattered glass. The war had ended a year ago—some said it was the end of everything—but she refused to believe it. At twenty-three, she’d seen too much: bombs that leveled homes, winters that stole breath, and hunger that gnawed at hope. Yet here she stood, alive, her boots crunching over rubble.</p>
                <p>The elders called it the Collapse, a time when the world’s might—its machines, its wealth—fell apart. But Lena saw something else. In the shadow of a toppled skyscraper, she found an old woman tending a garden, coaxing green from ash with gnarled hands. Down the street, a boy patched a wall with mud and salvaged brick, whistling as he worked. Across the river, wind spun a turbine cobbled from scrap, lighting a single bulb in a tent.</p>
                <p>She joined them, her own hands blistered from hauling stones to shore up a bridge. Days turned to weeks, and the work spread—strangers became neighbors, sharing tools and stories. A farmer brought seeds, a teacher opened a book under a tarp, and a singer’s voice lifted over the ruins. The city didn’t rise like before, gleaming and cold. It grew, messy and warm, stitched together by will.</p>
                <p>One night, under a sky scarred with stars, Lena looked out at the flickering lights and makeshift homes. The world’s strength, she realized, wasn’t in what it built to last forever—it was in the stubborn, quiet force of those who refused to let it die.</p>
